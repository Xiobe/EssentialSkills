# EssentialSkills
The idea of this project is to document essential skills.

The Essential Skills project is just a way to document essential skills for IT people.
Working in the field of Security I noticed that often things taken for granted are not really well understood.
The idea is to make a repository that can be used as a quick reference or even as course material.
